This repository contains my final project for Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering 162A, Mechanisms and Mechanical Systems, taken with Prof. Jonathan Hopkins, Spring 2021

The project involved designing and simulating a horizontal-platform mechanism which can turn angular rotation into linear motion using only linkages, R-joints, and a motor. The mechanism was required to fit within a finite space, and the angular deviation of the linearly moving linkage (referred to as the tabletop) was required to be less than 1Â° from the horizontal. A kinematic analysis using second-order differential equations was done in MATLAB to simulate the device.
